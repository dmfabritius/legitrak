<div id=daily><font size=5>Daily Report</font><br><br>
The daily report is automatically generated each workday morning at 3 AM. It combines data from the daily status, calendar, and digest
as posted on www.leg.wa.gov. The collected data is then correlated against the data in your
tracking lists to produce an informative summary report.<br><br>
The report is presented in four sections: Calendar Items, Bills with Activity, Possible Bills of Interest, and Bill Details. The layout
is customizable, allowing you to choose which sections appear and in what order.<br><br>
The Calendar Items section shows which bills from your tracking lists are scheduled to be discussed in upcoming committee meetings, based on the
meeting agenda.<br><br>
The Bills with Activity section shows which bills were active the previous day, based on a flag in the daily status.<br><br>
The Bills of Interest section uses keywords you can associate with your tracking lists to search the daily digest for potentially interesting bills.<br><br>
The Bill Details section shows the digests of the bills matching your keywords. A link to the full text of the bill is also provided.
</div>
<div id=daily-ex><font size=5>Daily Report (Excel)</font><br><br>
The Microsoft Excel version of the daily report provides a concise summary of your tracking lists. This report combines data from the daily status
and the daily digests and correlates that against the data in your tracking lists. Unlike the regular daily report, this report includes all the
bills from all your tracking lists—not just those which have current activity.<br><br>
This report is available in two configurations: grouped by tracking list or in a strict columnar layout. The latter is especially useful for
obtaining a unified view of your entire account and can be quickly and easily sorted on any of the columns.
</div>
<div id=weekly><font size=5>Weekly Report</font><br><br>
The weekly report can be automatically generated for you each week or can be requested on demand. The report is intended for delivery to someone
not directly involved in daily activities, e.g., a client or director.<br><br>
The report is presented in sections: Comments, Bill Tracking Summary, Calendar Items, and Bill Details. The layout
is customizable, allowing you to choose which sections appear and in what order. By default, all the bills for a given tracking list
appear on this report, but you can choose to limit the report to a single priority.<br><br>
The Comments section allows you to provide remarks concerning the week’s events. There are two types, general (shared) and list-specific comments.<br><br>
The Bill Tracking Summary section shows the list of bills being tracked for this list, grouped by priority. The Bill Details section shows the
digest for each of these bills.<br><br>
The Calendar Items section shows which bills for this tracking list are scheduled to be discussed in upcoming committee meetings, based on the
meeting agenda.
</div>
<div id=weekly-ex><font size=5>Weekly Report (Excel)</font><br><br>
The Microsoft Excel version of the weekly report provides a concise summary of a single tracking list. This report combines data from the
daily status and the daily digests and correlates that against the data in a tracking list.
</div>
<div id=rollcall><font size=5>Roll Call Analysis</font><br><br>
The roll call analysis report is a post-session review of how each of the legislators voted on the bills in a given tracking list. It is analogous
to the vote records created by AWB and the WSLC, except it is specific to your bills.<br><br>
The Score column shows the number of times a given legislator voted Yea on a bill marked Support or Nay on a bill marked Oppose. The Percentage
column is calculated by dividing the score by the total number of votes taken where your list shows either Support or Oppose. Bills marked with
other positions (Concerns, Neutral, Monitor, or blank) are not counted. Also, absent or excused votes are not counted.<br><br>
After the report has been generated, you can change your position for each vote column on the spreadsheet, and the scores and percentages will be
re-calculated “on-the-fly.”
</div>
<div id=dist-el><font size=5>District Elections Report</font><br><br>
The district elections report summarizes the three races for each district onto a single page. Each race is presented in two parts: details about
the incumbent and a listing of the challengers.<br><br>
For each incumbent, the report shows their AWB/WSLC vote records, committee memberships, leadership positions, and any comments you have entered
about them.<br><br>
In the challengers section, the report shows a Democrat/Republican vote history for the race, the names and campaign names of the candidates,
their phone numbers, and any comments you have entered about them.
</div>
<div id=contribs><font size=5>Contribution Report</font><br><br>
The contribution report is specific to an individual tracking list and shows recommended contributions, actual contributions, and the difference
between them for each candidate. It also provides detailed contact information, including mailing address, phone number, and e-mail address.<br><br>
There are two versions of this report, one that includes all candidates and a second that includes only those candidates with non-zero
contribution amounts (either recommended or actual).<br><br>
Candidates can be placed into groups which will generate separate subtotals in addition to the grand totals printed at the end of the report.
</div>
<div id=matrix><font size=5>Contribution Analysis</font><br><br>
The contribution analysis report provides a consolidated view of the contribution activity for your entire account. This report can be customized
to include only those tracking lists which are actively participating in campaign financing. You can also choose which contribution type to report:
recommendations, actual amounts, or both. When both types are selected, they are shown on separate sheets with a third sheet showing the difference.<br><br>
Contributions for both the primary and general elections are shown, and totals are calculated for each candidate across all tracking lists included
in the report. Subtotals are calculated for House/Senate Democrats/Republicans for district races, and Democrats/Republicans for statewide races.<br><br>
After the primaries, the percentage of votes received by each candidate is included along with an indicator showing whether or not they passed
the primary.
