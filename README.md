# Legislative Tracking System

This was my first web application, created in 2001 using Classic ASP (the first beta releases of .NET Framework weren't released until late 2000).
It was primarily coded using VBScript (Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition) along with some rudementary JavaScript, both of which I learned
on my own via web searches as I wrote the app. At the time, I didn't know about AJAX, and ended up creating my own crude analogue to that technique.

I used Visual Studio 6.0 (and subsequent later versions) as my IDE. The app was hosted on a used Dell PowerEdge server running in my basement and
connected to the Internet via ADSL. The server ran Microsoft Windows Small Business Server Premium Edition, which included the core operating system,
IIS (web server), SQL Server (database), and ISA Server (firewall).

LegiTrak was the premier legislative bill tracking system for Washington State. An intelligent and intuitive web interface
allowed customers to quickly and easily track all areas of legislative activity, from session bills to candidate filings and contributions
to the state register. Powerful and professional reports delivered detailed information to lobbyists and governmental affairs staff,
as well as concise summaries for their clients and directors.
