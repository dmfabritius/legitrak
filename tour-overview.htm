<font size=4><b>Welcome to LegiTrak, the Premier Legislative Tracking System!</b></font>
<br><br>
<font size=3>
This self-directed tour was designed to allow you to quickly and easily familiarize yourself with LegiTrak and its main features.
Screenshots were taken for each of the pages shown in the submenu on the left.  Each screenshot contains several “hot spot” areas
which are highlighted when a page is loaded. When you place your mouse over these areas, a description of a particular feature
is shown. You can move your mouse below the screenshot at any time to highlight the hot spots.

LegiTrak is best viewed with the latest version of Internet Explorer using a screen resolution of 1024x768 and 24-bit color or better.
If your screen is set to 800x600, you can press F11 to make the browser window as large as possible (press F11 again to return to normal).
Netscape-family browsers and non-Windows platforms are supported, but with a slightly lesser degree of functionality.
